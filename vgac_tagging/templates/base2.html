             <p>You're tasked with labelling screenshots with their affordances. Affordances are basically the interactions that a character can have with a given obejct or area of the screen.</p>
             <p>We are not concerned with perfection or 100% `correct` labels. We are interested in your perception of the screenshots and what you expect the different objects in the image to do</p>
             <p>You'll label each unique 8x8 pixel tile and use mouse buttons to fix the labelled images as you see fit</p>

               <p>Below are some examples of our 9 videogame affordances in Super Mario Bros 3 and Legend of Zelda. We'll go over them from top to bottom and left to right. The orientation of the grid is different in this example than in the tagger</p>
             </div>
             <div>
                  <p>1. Solid things block the character's movement. Think of walls and floor blocks</p>
                  <p>2. Destroyable things might be removed from the screen by some action or interaction. Think of breakable/crumbling blocks and enemies</p>
                  <p>3. The player character can directly interact with usable things. Think of buttons and chests</p>
                  <p>4. Movable things may move around in the screen. Usually the player character, pushable blocks, enemies</p>
                  <p>5. Dangerous things will harm the player character. Think of enemies, projectiles, fires, spikes, etc.</p>
                  <p>6. Changeable things may change form after some interaction or event. Think of locked doors, switches, blocks that change when pressed</p>
                  <p>7. Portals move to a different area of the game world. Think of doors, edges of maps, stairs</p>
                  <p>8. Gettable things can be acquired and used by the player character, usually by touching. Think of power-ups, keys, and other items</p>
                  <p>9. UI elements are things that aren't a part the game world. Think of a health bar, map, inventory, menus</p>
                  <p>NOTE: Many objects and characters have multiple affordances associated with them, in which case all relevant affordances should be applied. Most enemies are Dangerous and Destroyable, most player characters are both Movable and Destroyable</p>
                  <p>ALSO NOTE: The background of a game scene has no affordances, for tiles that are part of the background you can simply hit Enter</p>
             </div>
               <img id = "examples" src="/devexamples">
               <div>
                    <p>Keyboard Controls</p>
                    <p>Below is a random screenshot from a game. On the right (if your browser is large enough) is the image with all locations of an 8x8 tile from the image highlighted in pink squares</p>
                    <p>
                          Your task is to choose which affordances apply to each tile and in doing so you'll label the whole image's affordances
                    </p>
                    <p> Each affordance image starts off as fully black (slightly transparent). This signifies no affordances holding. When you tag a tile or left click on these images they will turn white, signifying that the given affordance holds in that location</p>
                    <p>The Keys Q-W-E   A-S-D   and   Z-X-C  are mapped to the 3x3 grid of affordances below. Pressing them will tag / untag each affordance for the current tile. You can also use the checkboxes under each affordance image</p>
                    <p>When you've selected all affordances that apply to the current tile (which might be none, especially for background), press Enter / Return to move to the next tile</p>
                    <p>If you misclick a key or wish to go back to a previous tile, use Backspace / Delete to go back in the list</p>
                    <p>When you finish tagging all the tiles a pop-up will tell you there are no more tiles. At this point you should use the Left and Right mouse buttons to clean up the black and white affordance images.</p>
                    <p>You can hit enlarge button under an affordance to make it easier to draw on</p>
                    <p>Again, we are not interested in perfection, but small and uniquely shaped objects are difficult to capture only using tiles</p>
                    <p>When the affordance images match your perception of the image, hit Spacebar or the `Done` button to get a new image</p>
